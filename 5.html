                <h2>SARPAN HYBRID CUCUMBER - 30 SEEDS</h2>
                <p><strong>Scientific Name:</strong>Cucumis sativus</p>
                <p><h2><strong>Type:</strong></h2> Hybrid</p>
                <p><h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>SARPAN Hybrid Cucumber is a high-quality variety known for its crisp texture, smooth skin, and excellent flavor. Ideal for both fresh consumption and pickling, this hybrid offers high yields and disease resistance.</p>
                <p><h2><strong>High Yield:</strong></h2>SARPAN cucumbers produce a large number of fruits per plant, making them suitable for both home gardens and commercial production.</p>
               <p><h2><strong>Disease Resistance:</strong></h2>red to resist common cucumber diseases such as downy mildew and powdery mildew, ensuring healthier plants and better harvests.</p>
               <p><h2><strong>Enhanced Flavor:</strong></h2> Known for its refreshing taste, SARPAN cucumbers have a slightly sweet flavor profile, making them perfect for salads, sandwiches, and snacks.</p>
               <p><h2><strong>Nutritional Value:</strong></h2> RVSM 1135 soybeans are rich in protein (around 36-40%) and contain essential fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals.They are also a good source of dietary fiber and contain antioxidants, which contribute to overall health and well-being.
            </p>
            <h2><strong>1. Soil Preparation and Health:</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Choose the Right Location:</strong>Choose a site that receives full sun for at least 6-8 hours a day, which is crucial for optimal growth and fruit production.</p>
            <p><strong>Soil Testing:</strong>Prefers well-drained, loamy soil rich in organic matter. Soil pH should ideally be between 6.0 and 6.8.Conduct soil tests to determine nutrient levels and amend accordingly to create optimal growing conditions.</p>
            <p><strong>Organic Matter:</strong>Add organic matter such as compost, well-rotted manure, or cover crops to improve soil structure, fertility, and moisture retention.
                Organic matter enhances microbial activity, which is crucial for healthy soil.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>2. Crop Rotation:</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Rotate Crops:</strong>Rotate cucumbers with non-cucurbit crops (such as legumes or cereals) to help reduce disease and pest buildup in the soil.</p>

            <h2><strong>3. Proper Planting Techniques:</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Planting Depth:</strong>Sow seeds at a depth of about 1 inch to ensure good germination.</p>
            <p><strong>Spacing:</strong>Space plants 12-18 inches apart in rows that are 3-4 feet apart to allow for ample growth and air circulation.</p>

            <h2><strong>4. Water Management:</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Consistent Watering: </strong> Consistent watering is crucial, especially during flowering and fruit development. Aim to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged..</p>
            <p><strong>Drip Irrigation: </strong>Consider using drip irrigation to minimize water on the leaves, reducing the risk of fungal diseases.
</p>

            <h2><strong>5. Seedling Production</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Starting Seeds:</strong>Start seeds indoors 3-4 weeks before the last frost or sow directly in the garden after frost risk has passed.</p>
            <p><strong>Light and Temperature:</strong>Optimal soil temperature for germination is between 70°F and 95°F.</p>

            <h2><strong>6. Fertilization</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Initial Fertilization:</strong>Apply a balanced fertilizer at planting time to promote strong root development.</p>
            <p><strong>Side-Dressing:</strong> Side dress with additional nitrogen fertilizer when plants begin to vine to support growth and fruit development.</p>
