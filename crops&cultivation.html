            </p>
            <h2><strong>1. Soil Preparation and Health:</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Choose the Right Location:</strong>Select a site with well-draining soil and full sun exposure (6-8 hours daily).</p>
            <p><strong>Soil Testing:</strong>Test the soil for pH and nutrient levels. Amend as necessary to create optimal growing conditions.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Organic Matter:</strong>Incorporate compost or well-rotted manure to improve soil fertility and structure.
            </p>

            <h2><strong>2. Crop Rotation:</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Rotate Crops:</strong>Avoid planting tomatoes (and other nightshades) in the same location year after year. Rotate with non-nightshade crops to reduce disease buildup in the soil.</p>

            <h2><strong>3. Proper Planting Techniques:</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Planting Depth:</strong>Plant seedlings deeply to encourage strong root systems.</p>
            <p><strong>Spacing:</strong>Ensure adequate spacing between plants to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the leaves, helping to prevent fungal diseases.</p>

            <h2><strong>4. Water Management:</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Consistent Watering: </strong> Water regularly to keep soil evenly moist, especially during fruit development. Avoid overwatering to prevent root rot.</p>
            <p><strong>Drip Irrigation: </strong>Consider using drip irrigation to deliver water directly to the roots, minimizing leaf wetness and reducing disease risk.
</p>

            <h2><strong>5. Seedling Production</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Starting Seeds:</strong>Start seeds indoors 6-8 weeks before the last expected frost date. Use seed trays or pots filled with seed-starting mix.</p>
            <p><strong>Light and Temperature:</strong>Keep seedlings in a warm location (70-75Â°F) with plenty of light, using grow lights if necessary.</p>

            <h2><strong>6. Fertilization</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Initial Fertilization:</strong>Apply a balanced fertilizer (e.g., 10-10-10) at planting time.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Side-Dressing:</strong> Fertilize again mid-season with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer as the plants begin to set fruit to support growth.</p>
